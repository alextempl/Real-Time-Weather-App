# Real-Time-Weather-App
An application using NWS API and JavaFX that shows the temperature, wind, precipitation, and five-day forecast.

This project was assigned to me as a part of my Software Design course, with the basic premise of the project being to utilize UI/UX in a working project after learning basic elements in JavaFX.
