# Real-Time-Weather-App
An application using the NWS API and JavaFX that shows the temperature, wind, precipitation, and five-day forecast.

This project was assigned to me as a part of my Software Design course, with the basic premise of the project being to utilize UI/UX in a working project after learning basic elements in JavaFX. 

The first screen of the app shows the user the current temperature, wind, and precipitation, as well as options to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The user can then click on a button that will take them to a five-day forecast, which shows the weather information (temperature, wind, precipitation) for the next five days. Each screen contains visual icons for the current or projected weather, as well as a background of the Chicago skyline and the current date and time.

Accurate weather data is provided to the user in a concise and visually pleasing manner. Added functionalities, such as Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion and time and date, give the user extra convenience in checking the weather using this application specifically.

The NWS API is used to retrieve current and future weather data. The application parses through a JSON file that is obtained after requesting from the API, after which each day is stored as a "Period" object that contains each data point (temperature, wind, precipitation) as an element that can be accessed by the program.

Overall, the app provides an easy-to-use and convenient way for users to check the weather to prepare for the day ahead.
